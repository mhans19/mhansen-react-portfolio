                        I am a 27 year old Idaho native, Utah implant. I am a newlywed and dog-mom to my mini wiener dog, Romy. 
                        I am a complete homebody and introvert that loves reading, creating, and occasionally binge-watching the latest and greatest TV shows.
                        In 2015, I graduated from Boise State University with dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Psychology and Criminal Justice. In 2016, I 
                        moved to Utah and in 2018, earned my Master of Science degree in Quantitative Psychology from Utah State University. Shortly after graduating,
                        I began working for the Utah Department Department of Human Services as a Research Consultant for the Division of Juvenile Justice Services. 
                        In 2020, I chose to develop my deep passion for data science and programming further by becaming a full-stack web developer.
